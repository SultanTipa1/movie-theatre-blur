# Flatdango-codechallenge

# Introduction

For this assessment, you'll be working on Flatdango.

Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! You will be building out an

application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the

theater.

# Project Setup

Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

Create a new project folder.
Create a new GitHub repository

## Starting the project

Run this command to get the backend started:

$ json-server --watch db.json

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

# Coredelivarables

As a user, I can:

1.See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of

available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of

`tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET

request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

GET /films/1

Example Response:

{

     "id": "1",

     "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",

     "runtime": "108",

     "capacity": 30,

     "showtime": "04:00PM",

     "tickets_sold": 27,

     "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",

     "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"

}

2.See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films`
element when the page loads. (_optional_: you can style each film in the list

by adding the classes `film item` to each `li` element.) There is a

placeholder `li` in the `ul#films` element that is hardcoded in the HTML â€”

feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use

JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list. You

will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the

film data:

GET /films

Example response:

[

      {

        "id": "1",

        "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",

        "runtime": "108",

        "capacity": 30,

        "showtime": "04:00PM",

        "tickets_sold": 27,

        "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",

        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"

      },

      {

        "id": "2",

        "title": "Manos: The Hands Of Fate",

        "runtime": "118",

        "capacity": 50,

        "showtime": "06:45PM",

        "tickets_sold": 44,

        "description": "A family gets lost on the road and stumbles upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master and his servant Torgo.",

        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/47781/p47781_v_v8_ac.jpg"

      },

      {
      "id": "3",
      "title": "Time Chasers",
      "runtime": "93",
      "capacity": 50,
      "showtime": "09:30PM",
      "tickets_sold": 31,
      "description": "An inventor comes up with a time machine, but must prevent its abuse at the hands of an evil C.E.O.",
      "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/23342/p23342_v_v8_ab.jpg"
    }

3.Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not

be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets

available). **No persistence is needed for this feature**.
